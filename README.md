Barbershop [HTML, SCSS, JS, Parcel]

Individual project
Landing page of a barber shop with responsive and adaptive layout, including interesting customization of Swiper slider. Smooth scrolls, nice mobile menu and pretty booking form makes it comfortable to make appointments. Responsive and art directed photos will make it easier and faster to get access to the website (including retina screens).
